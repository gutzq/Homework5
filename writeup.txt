The features that are implemented are a working scrabble one line board that is able to be submitted to get words score.
You are able to reset the game whenever you deem necessary. You are also able to drag and drop tiles sucessfully. What 
I didn't quite get to was removing letters from the tilerack after updating the gameboard. And I was having issues with updating 
words score I was only able to multiply the letter. The only other implementation that was not included was words over 2 letters you can
submit and letter as a word.
